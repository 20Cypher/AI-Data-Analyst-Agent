# Summary of Analysis Results

## Description
The analysis focused on identifying which product had the highest quantity sold from the sales dataset, which contains 35 rows and 8 columns.

## Key Findings
- The total quantity sold across all products was 85.0, with a mean quantity of approximately 2.43.
- The maximum quantity sold for a single product was 6.0, while the minimum was 1.0.
- The products with the highest quantities recorded were:
  - **AI Handbook**: 1.0
  - **Air Purifier**: 1.0
  - **Blender**: 2.0
  - **Camera**: 2.0
  
  None of the products reached the maximum quantity of 6.0, indicating that the highest quantity sold for any individual product was relatively low.

## Notable Patterns
The data shows that the highest quantity sold for any product was 6.0, but this quantity was not attributed to any specific product in the results. The majority of products had quantities below this maximum, suggesting a potential limitation in product sales volume.

## Limitations
The analysis does not provide insights into which specific product achieved the maximum quantity of 6.0, as no product was listed with that quantity in the results. This lack of clarity limits the ability to identify the top-selling product definitively.
